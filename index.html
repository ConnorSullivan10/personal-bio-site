  <div class="fullPage" id="bioPage">
    <p id="bio">     I received my undergraduate degrees in Marketing and Psychology with aspirations of working as a marketer in the music industry.
        After establishing my career as a marketer and director of client relations for a music studio in Jacksonville, I worked for Web.com,
        a Digital Marketing Agency where I was introduced to PPC and SEO advertising, and had my first hands-on experience with HTML and CSS
        while working on Landing Pages for digital marketing campaigns I was building.
            Growing up, I was always fascinated with figuring out how things worked, whether it was taking apart a broken computer as a child 
        to see all the internal parts, or working on guitar amps and guitar electronics throughout my teen years and emerging adulthood. So
        once I was able to work on landing pages at Web.com and get my first taste of what website coding looked like, the door to my curiousity
        was blown right open. It didn't take long for me to realize that the expanse of coding languages and possibilites was a further rabbit hole
        than I could ever imagine, but thanks to my brief experience working on Landing Pages, as well as through the encouragement of
        numerous developer friends, I decided that becoming a developer was my next destination on my career path.
            I had full intentions of starting fresh after living in Jacksonville for 12 years, and after visiting Nashville numerous times over the
        years, I knew Nashville was my next destination, especially after I discovered NSS. In January of 2019 I made it my mission to get to Nashville, and after sending out a plethora 
        of applications throughout the new year, I recieved a job offer from a startup called Takl at the end of February, and the rest is history.
            I'm extremely grateful for the skills I've established as a Digital Marketing Analyst, but the simple fact is that I've quickly
        achieved a point where I feel my interests in and the challenges from Digital Marketing have been very short-lived, and I appreciate
        the consistent learning, challenges, creativity, and (in my opinion) more-tangible and direct results I am able to drive as a developer.</p>
