# Personal Bio Site

## Description
This single-page application is a formatted to be a Personal bio site to display my work and background, going into a development career. The current version of the website is merely a rough draft, and includes a navigation bar at the top to display my biography, the technologies I've used, along with some of my development projects at the current date. Clicking the titled buttons at the top left of the page will bring you to each corresponding page listed (including my name at the top and contact info in the footer).
